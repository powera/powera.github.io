  "query": "Q: A man had a donkey and a small Pomeranian dog. The donkey lived in a stable with plenty of oats and hay, but spent his days working at the mill and carrying heavy loads of wood from the forest to the farm. The Pomeranian, on the other hand, knew many tricks and was fondled by his master, who always gave him tasty treats. The donkey envied the life of the Pomeranian and one day decided to make his way into the master’s house, imitating the Pomeranian’s tricks as best as he could. In doing so, he broke the master’s table and smashed his precious dishes to pieces. Seeing this, the servants quickly drove the donkey back into the stable, kicking and beating him with clubs all the way, nearly killing him. What is the moral of this story?\nA. To be satisfied with one's lot is better than to desire something which one is not fitted to receive.\nB. A needy thief steals more than one who enjoys plenty.\nC. Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.\nD. It is easier to get into the enemy's toils than out again.",

Spare the rod and spoil the child.\nB. Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.\nC. Self-help is the best help.\nD. It is thrifty to prepare today for the wants of tomorrow.",

  "query": "Q: \"Papa,\" said the small toad to the larger one sitting by the side of a pond, \"Yesterday, I came across a huge monster! It was the size of a mountain, had giant horns and a long tail, as well as hoofs that were split in two.\" \"Don’t be alarmed, child\", replied the older toad, \"that was just an oxen. There are many of those around the farms. It’s not nearly as big as you say, either. Indeed, I could make myself just as big as him. Let me show you.\" Having said that, he inhaled a lot of air and blew himself out. \"Was he as big as I am now?\", he asked his son. \"No, he was much bigger than that!\" replied the smaller toad. The father drew in even more air, and asked again if the oxen had been as big as he now was. \"Even bigger than this, father!\" was the reply. So the toad took one last deep breath and burst with a loud pop. What is the moral of this story?\nA. Some men can blow hot and blow cold with the same breath.\nB. Self-conceit may lead to self-destruction.\nC. If words suffice not, blows must follow.\nD. Quality is better than quantity.",

  "query": "Q: A birdcatcher didn’t have much success that day and was about to have a small dinner of herbs and vegetables, when a friend came to visit. Since his traps were empty, he decided to kill a partridge that he used as a decoy. The bird begged him to spare her, saying that he wouldn’t be able to catch birds in the future without her help, nor fall asleep to her relaxing chirps. The birdcatcher saw reason in her words and instead decided to butcher a young rooster whom he kept in his yard. The rooster, too, pleaded with his owner, saying that without his crawling, the birdcatcher wouldn’t know  when to collect his traps, nor would he be able to rise early in the morning. Having heard him out, the birdcatcher finally said: \"Your words make sense. However, my friend and I are hungry and must have our meal.\" What is the moral of this story?\nA. Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.\nB. Necessity knows no law.\nC. Necessity is the mother of invention.\nD. Better no rule than cruel rule.",

  "query": "Q: One time, the sun and the wind were debating which one of them was the strongest. As they quarreled, they saw a traveller come down a road and the sun suggested that whoever manages to make the traveller take off his cloak would be considered the strongest of them both. The wind started by blowing as hard as he could, but that only made the traveller wrap his cloak tighter around his shoulders, until the wind finally gave up. The sun, in turn, shone warm rays of light upon the traveller. Feeling hot, he soon took of his cloak to feel more comfortable, thus handing the victory to the sun. What is the moral of this story?\nA. Fine clothes may disguise, but silly words will disclose a fool.\nB. Whatever you do, do with all your might.\nC. Straws show how the wind blows.\nD.
